 from the EMPLOYEE table in the Starr database. 
The columns must be in the order specified in the result set. 
The query returns all rows from the table.

"M.I." "Last Name" respectively. 
The aliases must appear exactly as specified above in the result set, i.e. must be a space between "First" and "Name". 
The columns must be in the order specified in the result set. The query returns all rows from the table.
