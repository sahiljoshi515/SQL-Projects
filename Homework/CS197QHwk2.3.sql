/*
CS197Q Homework assignment 2.3
SQLite note: in JOIN queries with USING, you need to use parentheses to specify the column name.
For example:   TableA JOIN TableB USING (ColumnC) 
  2.13 Join Queries
  2.14 Join Operator
  2.15 Multi-Table Joins
  2.16 Outer Joins
  2.17 Grouping
  2.18 Grouping - the Having Clause
Use the Starr database for this assignment.
Consult the Starr Schema information in the DB Browser and the Starr Database ERD diagram as needed.

NOTE: It is easier to build queries in small steps. For example, if you are writing a join query, 
focus first on getting the join part to work correctly, then you can add any other constraints, and 
finally add the columns you need to the select clause. 
You can open a new SQL editor window to use as a "scratch" window for executing these types of queries.

Remember to remove all SQL that isn't the answer to a question before submitting this file.

	  Use any join technique you wish, but make sure your joins are correct! If two tables have more than one relationship
	  between then, a natural join may give incorrect results.
	  NOTE: Each project is managed by one employee. This "manages" role or relationship is implemented 
	  by the EMP_NUM keys in the PROJECT and EMPLOYEE tables. Employees are also assigned to work on projects. 
	  This "assigned" role is implemented by the EMP_NUM keys in the ASSIGNMENT and EMPLOYEE tables.
	  This query deals with the "assigned" role, not the "manages" role. There is only one employee manager
	  for each project, but there are many employees who can be assigned to work on a project. Make sure you
	  write your joins so you are getting the correct relationship in your results.
