  NOTE: In many cases, you can check your results by executing "exploratory" queries and inspecting the 
        table values directly. For example, select * from employee will show you the entire table. You 
	    can then look at the rows that the query you are crafting should return and check that against
	    the results it actually returns. In some cases, the number of rows you should get is provided.
	    Don't be afraid to execute these "exploratory" queries when you are building a complex query.
	Remember not to include any of these in the file you turn in- only your answers to the questions.

/* 3. Write a SELECT query that retrieves all columns from the EMPLOYEE table. Add a condition in a WHERE clause
